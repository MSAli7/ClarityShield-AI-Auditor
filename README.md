## How It Works

ClarityShield isn't just a static linter. It leverages a sophisticated Large Language Model (LLM) that has been fine-tuned on a vast dataset of both secure and vulnerable Clarity smart contracts. When you submit your code, the AI performs a deep contextual analysis to identify potential issues that traditional scanners might miss, providing you with nuanced, human-like feedback.
